![Lost yesterday... ](/img/horace_mann0.jpg)

Lost yesterday somewhere between sunrise and sunset.
Two golden hours each set with sixty diamond minutes.

No reward is offerred for they are gone forever

Horace Mann(1796 - 1859) - American Educator.

A good reminder in these times. Written in the Foundational hand.
