Another attempt at the machines of loving grace poem. This is a rough
draft which I'm going to use to do a more serious layout.

I recently got a 6mm Pilot parallel pen. I used that to write this *i*
and tried some rough texturing using a 0.1mm Rotring isograph with
white ink. It doesn't look very good up close but from far, it gives some life to the letters.
