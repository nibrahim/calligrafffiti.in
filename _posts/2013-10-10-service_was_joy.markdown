![service was joy](/img/tagore1.jpg)

This is nice quote by Rabindranath Tagore. I heard of it from the [recent comic from the excellent zencomics website](http://zenpencils.com/comic/133-rabindranath-tagore-the-joy-of-life/). The larger letters are using a speedball C3 nib. The rest is with a C4 nib.
