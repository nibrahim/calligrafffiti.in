![Forever is the way I feel for you](/img/forever0.jpg)

The first two stanzas of the song "Forever I feel for you" by Chantelle Duncan. The [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-rAi-2hZ6U) is on the soundtrack of the movie The Man from Earth. I enjoyed the movie and the song was a perfect finish.

The heading was done using a speedball C1 nib and the body using a speedball C4.

This a closeup. You can see how the paper has degenerated and started to make the ink bleed. I should get new paper but can't find the right weight.
