![Whose axe is bloodier?](/img/canticle0.jpg)

A quote from Walter M. Miller Jr.'s [Canticle for Leibowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz). I highly recommend the book.

I got the quote from [Musa Furber's blog](http://musafurber.com/blog/blog/2013/04/05/dot-dot-dot-theres-no-longer-much-meaning-in-asking-whose-ax-is-bloodier-dot/).
