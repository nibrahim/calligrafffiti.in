![Machines of loving grace](/img/loving-grace.jpg)

This is a first cut of a piece I'm making for a friend. I did it to
figure out the sizes that would work and also the layout. The eleven
lines at the top are done using a C4 sized nib. The last three using a
C3.

I'm going to redo this fixing the alignment and adjusting the letter
sizes.

This is closeup from the previous piece where you can actually see the
paper fibres. It's interesting how different this is from digital typography.
